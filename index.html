  <article><h2>Services and Description. &nbsp;</h2>
    <p>Hello, My name is Salvi and I’m a double-certified Pilates mat and Apparatus specialist. I designed this program for individuals who are interested in becoming more flexible and positive through exercise, but are procrastinating to leave the house in search of what they are looking for. Specifically, kind souls who have thigh schedules: thighs to look after, choirs, pets they can't leave alone, or just are— a bit introverted.</p>
    <p>.</p>
<h2>NOW YOU DON'T NEED TO STRESS OUT ABOUT THAT!</h2>
   <p>Long story short, at first, this program was personalized for a single mom who couldn't leave their child alone during the evenings. So, we came up with a plan suitable for her schedule, and just like the Zoom classes ( BUT MORE COOLER) I visited her and practiced traditional Pilates WITH her. AND just like the study shows, doing group activities is more challenging and beneficial for our bodies and minds. Imagine? You have to do your best. So, this is how Mobile Pilates began its journey……What stopping you?</p>
